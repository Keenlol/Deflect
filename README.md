## 🎮 Game Overview

_Deflect_ is a fast-paced 2D side-scrolling survival game where players can't directly attack — instead, they must **deflect** enemy attacks to damage them. Players must time their defenses to survive increasingly difficult enemy waves.

## 🕹️ Core Mechanics

- **Side-scrolling movement**: Move left/right and jump like a Mario-style platformer.
- **Double Jump & Dash**: Perform agile maneuvers to avoid attacks.
- **Deflection System**: Use precise timing to deflect projectiles and melee attacks back at enemies.
- **Endless Loop Gameplay**: Survive as long as possible. Difficulty scales with time and performance.
